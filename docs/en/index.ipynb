    "# Welcome to OMMX Quantum Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "OMMX Quantum Benchmarks provides access to quantum optimization benchmark datasets in [OMMX](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html) format for easier integration with quantum and classical optimization workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository collects optimization benchmark datasets and converts them to OMMX (Optimization Model Exchange) format. Currently, the collection includes selected datasets from [QOBLIB (Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library)](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library), with plans to expand to additional benchmark sources in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Status**: The initial release focuses on converting datasets from QOBLIB. Additional benchmark collections may be added in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Included\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benchmark Collection**: Quantum optimization datasets converted to OMMX format\n",
    "- **Python API**: Simple interface for accessing benchmark instances\n",
    "- **GitHub Container Registry**: Distributed storage for easy access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Currently Available Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### From QOBLIB Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available with instances**:\n",
    "- **Market Split** (`01_marketsplit`) - 160+ instances across binary linear and unconstrained models\n",
    "- **Labs** (`02_labs`) - 99 instances for integer and quadratic unconstrained models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Framework defined for future expansion**:\n",
    "- Birkhoff, Steiner, Sports, Portfolio, Independent Set, Network, Routing, and Topology categories are implemented but may not contain instances yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You can check current instance availability for any dataset using the `available_instances` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Benchmark Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is designed to accommodate additional benchmark collections beyond QOBLIB as they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
