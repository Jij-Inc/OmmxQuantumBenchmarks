    "# Welcome to OMMX Quantum Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "OMMX Quantum Benchmarks provides access to quantum optimization benchmark datasets in [OMMX](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html) format for easier integration with quantum and classical optimization workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository collects optimization benchmark datasets and converts them to OMMX (Open Mathematical prograMming eXchange) format. Currently, the collection includes selected datasets from [QOBLIB (Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library)](https://git.zib.de/qopt/qoblib-quantum-optimization-benchmarking-library), with plans to expand to additional benchmark sources in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Status**: The initial release focuses on converting datasets from QOBLIB. Additional benchmark collections may be added in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Included\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benchmark Collection**: Quantum optimization datasets converted to OMMX format\n",
    "- **Python API**: Simple interface for accessing benchmark instances\n",
    "- **GitHub Container Registry**: Distributed storage for easy access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Currently Available Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### From QOBLIB Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available with instances**:\n",
    "- **Labs** (`02_labs`) - 99 instances for integer and quadratic unconstrained models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Framework defined for future expansion**:\n",
    "- MarketSplit, Birkhoff, Steiner, Sports, Portfolio, Independent Set, Network, Routing, and Topology categories are implemented but do not contain instances yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You can check current instance availability for any dataset using the `available_instances` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Benchmark Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is designed to accommodate additional benchmark collections beyond QOBLIB as they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with OMMX Quantum Benchmarks, see the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.ipynb) for installation instructions and basic usage examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn More\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore our documentation to learn more about the benchmark collection capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.ipynb): Installation and basic usage examples\n",
    "- [Usage Guide](tutorial/usage/index_usage.ipynb): Detailed information on working with datasets and instances\n",
    "- [Examples](tutorial/examples/index_examples.ipynb): Practical examples for different problem types\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this package is currently in development and not yet published on PyPI, install directly from the GitHub repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Clone the repository\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/Jij-Inc/OmmxQuantumBenchmarks.git\n",
    "cd OmmxQuantumBenchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install in development mode with pip\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or install in development mode with uv\n",
    "uv pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can install directly from GitHub without cloning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Using pip\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/Jij-Inc/OmmxQuantumBenchmarks.git\n",
