# OMMX Quantum Benchmarks
OMMX Quantum Benchmarks provides access to quantum optimization benchmark datasets in [OMMX](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html) format for easier integration with quantum and classical optimization workflows.

Documentation: https://jij-inc.github.io/OmmxQuantumBenchmarks/

## Quick Start
### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Jij-Inc/OmmxQuantumBenchmarks.git
cd OmmxQuantumBenchmarks
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from ommx_quantum_benchmarks.qoblib import Labs

# Load a dataset
dataset = Labs()
instance, solution = dataset("integer", "labs002")

# Evaluate the solution
evaluated = instance.evaluate(solution.state)
print(f"Objective: {evaluated.objective}, Feasible: {evaluated.feasible}")
```

You should get the following result.

```bash
Objective: 1.0, Feasible: True
```

The `instance` is `ommx.v1.Instance`. OMMX (Open Mathematical prograMming eXchange) is an open data format and SDK designed to simplify data exchange between software and people when applying mathematical optimization to real-world problems. For more details about OMMX, please have a look at the documentation: [Documentation](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html).

## Datasets
Note that, although this repository currently contains only one dataset, QOBLIB, we are planning to add more datasets for quantum optimisation in OMMX format.

### QOBLIB
QOBLIB stands for Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library. In this repository we provide instance data given in the original QOBLIB repository in `ommx` format leveraging the power of Github Container Registry. Note that currently, this directory does not provide all datasets, such as the fourth dataset Steiner Tree Packing pointed out in [issue 8](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/OMMX-OBLIB/issues/8). One can see which instance data are available accessing `available_instances` property.
